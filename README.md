# Dopamine

Dopamine is a feature-rich Discord moderation and utility bot built with a focus on performance and ease of use. Originally designed as a private project to express creativity and give back to the Discord community, it is now open-sourced under the AGPL-3.0 license.

The bot is designed to handle everything from point-based moderation to automated server engagement tools like Haiku detection and scheduled messages.

This a 100% free-to-use, non-profit Discord bot (solo) project by LikerOfTurtles.

# Features

### Moderation & Administration

* Point-Based System: A customizable moderation system where actions (warn, ban, etc.) carry point values. Includes an automated decay system so users aren't penalized indefinitely for old mistakes.

* Slowmode Scheduler: Schedule slowmode to enable/disable automatically at specific times of the day.

* Comprehensive Logging: Detailed logs for all moderator actions and bot activities.

### Utility & Engagement

* Scheduled Messages: Set up recurring announcements (daily, weekly, monthly) using a simple modal-based setup.

* Starboard & LFG: Community-driven features for highlighting great content or organizing groups for gaming/events.

* Haiku Detection: Automatically detects messages in the 5-7-5 syllable format and reformats them.

* Member Tracker: Tracks server growth with customizable embeds and goal-setting.

* Global Notes: Store and retrieve notes across any server where the bot is present (requires user-install/profile addition).
