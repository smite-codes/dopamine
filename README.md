* Slowmode Scheduler: Schedule slowmode to enable/disable automatically at specific times of the day.

* Comprehensive Logging: Detailed logs for all moderator actions and bot activities.

### Utility & Engagement

* Scheduled Messages: Set up recurring announcements (daily, weekly, monthly) using a simple modal-based setup.

* Starboard & LFG: Community-driven features for highlighting great content or organizing groups for gaming/events.

* Haiku Detection: Automatically detects messages in the 5-7-5 syllable format and reformats them.

* Member Tracker: Tracks server growth with customizable embeds and goal-setting.

* Global Notes: Store and retrieve notes across any server where the bot is present (requires user-install/profile addition).

# The Team

Dopamine is a **solo-project** by me, **Smite**. And I plan to keep it that way for the foreseeable future.

I started this project as a simple point-based moderation bot because I really like the concept - Now, it has evolved into a whole ecosystem of features within just six months.
